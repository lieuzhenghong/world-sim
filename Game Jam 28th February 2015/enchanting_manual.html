<h1 id="enchanting">Enchanting</h1>
<hr>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of enchanting is to make a living by enchanting <strong>MAGICAL ITEMS</strong> for others to use. Anything can be a magical item, but common ones include weapons, armour and jewellery such as rings or amulets. </p>
<h2 id="about-enchanting">About Enchanting</h2>
<p>Enchanting is not easy. That&#39;s why you had to spend five years in a tower with a smelly old wizard washing his soiled robes. Enchanting requires one or more <strong>REAGENTS</strong>, a magical <strong>SOURCE</strong> and your own knowledge.   </p>
<h3 id="reagents">Reagents</h3>
<p>Reagents are the ingredients that shape raw magical energy into something useful. Reagents can range from the mundane (hair of dog, limpwurt root, bougainvilla leaf) to the exotic (lich phylactery, diamond dust). Different reagents do different things but not all reagents do something useful!</p>
<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>
<p>Sources are fountains of magical energy an enchanter can tap on to create magical items. Sources include: lyrium powder, literal magical fountains (themselves enchanted by enchanters). 
The Law of Magical Conservation states that the amount of magical energy in a magical item can never exceed that of the magical energy in the source. Therefore procuring good sources is critical for enchanting.</p>
<h3 id="enchantment-types">Enchantment Types</h3>
<p>There are two classes of enchantments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Skill enchantments;</li>
<li>Effect enchantments.</li>
</ol>
<p>Effect enchantments are the most general. They can affect an <strong>effect</strong> on themselves or their surroundings. An effect is like a basic version of a spell. For example, a magical fountain has the following effects:</p>
<p> <code>Infuse Water: 1 mana/sec, Store 1 mana in item WATER every second.</code></p>
<p> A speeding rock could have the following effects:</p>
<p>  <code>Speed Surroundings: 4X mana/sec, Find X targets around 2m radius and INCREASE movement speed by 20%.</code></p>
<p>  Skill enchantments provide a boost in <strong>skill</strong>. The mechanism behind how this works isn&#39;t fully known yet, but basically any skill you can think of can be improved. A sword of Strong Strikes might have the following effects:</p>
<p>   <code>Strengthen Strikes: 12 mana/strike, INCREASE damage by 12 per successful attack.</code></p>
<h3 id="enchantment-capacity">Enchantment Capacity</h3>
<p>Every item has a <strong>mana capacity</strong>. That means that you can only (safely) pump that amount of mana into it. Exceeding an item&#39;s <strong>mana cap</strong> can cause unwanted effects, such as unreliable performance, magical explosions, and item disintegration. The ESHA (Enchantment Safety and Health Association) has dictated that all enchantments must not exceed the mana cap of the enchanted item. As a proud ESHA-compliant enchanter you will of course follow this rule.</p>
<p>Some mana caps of common items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wooden staff, 1 m long with 2 cm diameter: 200 mana</li>
<li>Copper coin: 5 mana</li>
<li>Silver coin: 50 mana</li>
<li>Gold coin: 500 mana</li>
<li>Wooden bowl: 40 mana</li>
<li>Iron sword with handle: 200 mana</li>
</ul>
